---
- Machines <- Data + Learning Algorithm
- Machines -> Find Solutions |

---
## Trends, Predictions

- Identify hidden trends
- Leverage trends for predictions |
- Compute probabilities of possible outcomes |
---

## Recipe

- Prepare data improve its quality
- Shortlist algorithm |
- Tune paramters |
- Build and run models |

---
## Tabular data form

- Columns are variables aka attributes aka features
- Rows are data points

---
## Variable types

- Binary
- Categorical |
- Integer |
- Continuous |

---
## Variable Selection

- Too many variables - slow computations, wrong
- Shortlist the important ones
- Often trial and error

---
## Feature engineering

- Group based on Species

---
## Dimension reduction

- Multiple variables -> combine
- You get more condenced information smaller variables |

---
## Missing Data

- Approximate
- Compute (bought umbrella --> buys coat)
- Remove - avoid

---
## Next Session - scan algorithms

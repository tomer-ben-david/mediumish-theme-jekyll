**Introduction**

Haskell is an amazing language to learn.  One of the most common reasons to learn haskell is not to use it in practice but to learn functional programming concepts.  Haskell makes the best method for learning functional programming.  For example if you are coming to scala, learning functional programming can be really difficult.  In haskell you get as a first class citizens many of the added FP library concepts to scala, for example a Monad is a first class citizen in haskell.  No need for scalaz or whatever.  Now you need a good book and I have a **great** book for you! The book is **[Learn You A Haskell For A Great Good](http://amzn.to/2fqADJ7)**.

**What the book covers**

So what does the book cover, or what did I learn from it? many things I found hard to grasp by other books! here is the list:

1. Types and type classes
1. Recursion
1. Higher order functions
1. Modules
1. Functors
1. Map,FlatMap etc
1. Monoids, Monads
1. IO
1. Functional Programming Concepts
1. How to understand haskell code
1. Great example's it explains just anything it shows you

Do you see the book is just amazing, and he does an **excellent** job describing these topics not as other books!

**Conclusion**
